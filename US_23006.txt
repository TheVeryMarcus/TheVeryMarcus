ID: US_23.006 | Organization Folder Management > View Build History Monitor

Description:

As a Jenkins user,
I want to monitor the build history of pipelines within an organization folder in real-time,
So that I can promptly identify and address any issues or failures as they occur.

Acceptance Criteria:

By navigating to the organization folder on the Dashboard, the user can access a real-time build history monitor.
Clicking on the "Build History Monitor" option opens a live view of ongoing and recent builds.
While on the build history monitor page, the user can:

See a real-time feed of builds with their current statuses (e.g., in progress, success, failure).
Receive notifications or alerts for build failures or significant events.
View detailed logs and progress for builds currently in progress.
Filter and sort builds by various criteria to focus on specific pipelines or issues. After monitoring the build history, the user can take immediate action if necessary, such as stopping a failing build or investigating issues.
