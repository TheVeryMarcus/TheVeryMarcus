ID: US_23.005 | Organization Folder Management > View Build History

Description:

As a Jenkins user,
I want to view the build history of pipelines within an organization folder,
So that I can track the progress and results of builds over time.

Acceptance Criteria:

By navigating to the organization folder on the Dashboard, the user can access the build history for each pipeline.
Clicking on the "Build History" option for a pipeline opens a detailed view of past builds.
While on the build history page, the user can:

See a chronological list of builds with their statuses (e.g., success, failure, in progress).
View detailed logs and artifacts for each build to diagnose issues.
Filter builds by date, status, or other criteria to find specific builds quickly.
Access options to restart or delete builds if necessary. After reviewing the build history, the user can return to the organization folder view or navigate to other sections of Jenkins.
