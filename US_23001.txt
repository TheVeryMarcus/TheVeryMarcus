ID: US_23.001 | Organization Folder Management > Open Pipeline from the Dashboard

Description:

As a Jenkins user,
I want to open a pipeline directly from the Dashboard,
So that I can quickly access and manage my pipelines without navigating through multiple menus.

Acceptance Criteria:

By clicking on a pipeline name or link on the Dashboard, the user can access the pipeline's details and configuration.
Clicking on the pipeline name in the Dashboard opens the pipeline page, where detailed information and configuration options are available.
While on the pipeline page, the user can:

View the pipeline's build history.
Trigger a new build manually.
Access and modify the pipeline configuration.
View logs and build artifacts. After making necessary changes or reviewing the pipeline, the user can return to the Dashboard or navigate to other sections of Jenkins.
