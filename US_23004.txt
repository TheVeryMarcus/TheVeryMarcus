ID: US_23.004 | Organization Folder Management > Delete Folder

Description:

As a Jenkins administrator,
I want to delete an organization folder,
So that I can remove unnecessary or outdated structures and keep the workspace organized.

Acceptance Criteria:

By navigating to the organization folder on the Dashboard, the user can access options to delete the folder.
Clicking on the "Delete Folder" option opens a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletion.
While in the confirmation dialog, the user can:

Review the name and contents of the folder to ensure the correct folder is being deleted.
Confirm the deletion by clicking "Yes" or "Delete".
Cancel the operation if needed. After confirming the deletion, the folder is removed from the system, and the user is redirected to the parent directory or the main Dashboard.
