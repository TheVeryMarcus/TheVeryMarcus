ID: US_23.002 | Organization Folder Management > Check Build status

Description:

As a Jenkins user,
I want to check the build status of pipelines within an organization folder,
So that I can monitor the progress and ensure that builds are completing successfully.

Acceptance Criteria:

By navigating to the organization folder on the Dashboard, the user can view the build status of all pipelines within that folder.
Clicking on the build status indicator (e.g., a colored dot or icon) next to each pipeline name opens a detailed view of the build history and current status.
While on the build status page, the user can:

See a list of recent builds with their statuses (e.g., success, failure, in progress).
View detailed logs for each build to diagnose issues.
Access options to restart or cancel builds if necessary.
Check the duration and timing of each build step. After reviewing the build status, the user can return to the organization folder view or navigate to other sections of Jenkins.
